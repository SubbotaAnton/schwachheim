# Security

- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or credentials.
- Validate and sanitize all external input.
- Use parameterized queries — never concatenate user input into SQL or commands.
- Apply the principle of least privilege everywhere.
- Keep dependencies up to date. Known vulnerabilities are the easiest attack vector.
