# Git & Version Control

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages. Focus on "why", not "what".
- Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit.
- Don't commit generated files, secrets, or environment-specific configs.
- Review your own diff before committing. Catch mistakes early.
- Branch names should be descriptive: `feature/add-auth`, `fix/login-redirect`.
