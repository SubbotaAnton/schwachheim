# Code Style & Conventions

- Consistency over personal preference. Follow existing patterns in the codebase.
- Use meaningful variable and function names. Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood.
- Keep files focused. One module = one responsibility.
- Prefer explicit over implicit. Magic is the enemy of maintainability.
- Avoid deep nesting. Extract early returns and guard clauses.
- Don't leave dead code, commented-out blocks, or TODOs without context.
