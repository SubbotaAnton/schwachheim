# Thinking & Problem Solving

- Always understand the "why" before jumping to the "how".
- Break complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
- Consider edge cases and failure modes before implementing.
- If something feels overly complex, step back and reconsider the approach.
- When stuck, re-read the requirements — the answer is often in what was asked.
- Validate assumptions. Don't guess — verify by reading code or docs.
